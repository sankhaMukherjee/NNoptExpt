Version 1.1

Done:
1. The libGA and NN models are totally rewritten. 
2. The libGA saves weights instead of NN classes
3. We insert the data into the weights using placeholders. Huge performance improvement.
4. GA Model weights can be directly saved. 
5. Older weights can be loaded before the start of another fitting run. 

ToDo:
Try something where the selection is based upon both the current errors as well as a bit
of gradient descent.

---------------------------
Version 1.0

Done:
1. library modules:
    1.1. libGA --> generate a GA Class
    1.2. NNmodel --> generate a NNmodel

ToDo:
1. Redo the libGA model to use a vector of weights rather
   than a vector of NNmodels. This is because the tensorflow
   models are really difficult to save. 

---------------------------
Version 0.0

1. the very basic interface. Nothing added as yet
