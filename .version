Version 1.0

Done:
1. library modules:
    1.1. libGA --> generate a GA Class
    1.2. NNmodel --> generate a NNmodel

ToDo:
1. Redo the libGA model to use a vector of weights rather
   than a vector of NNmodels. This is because the tensorflow
   models are really difficult to save. 

---------------------------
Version 0.0

1. the very basic interface. Nothing added as yet
